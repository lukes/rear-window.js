== features

- close (/hide) button
- make draggable
- when item is selected, and RW is focused, enable key navigation
- allow specifying what object to being inspecting
- option to remove all common objects from inspector (probably by loading iframe and comparing list of variables), including storage if storage is empty
- plugins for main JS libraries, to add their unique property types, and also event listeners (?)

== bugs

- handle displaying "storage" (see window.menubar, window.sessionStorage in FF)
