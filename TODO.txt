== need

- onunfocus of form field it returns to text

== want

- hide button
- make close button flatter
- draggable
- when item is selected, and RW is focused, enable key navigation
- plugins for main JS libraries, to add their unique property types, and also event listeners (?)
- see events (per JS library)
- correct pluralisation
- backwards while loops are quicker than for loops
- autocomplete for choosing a variable
- loading... message

- option to remove all common objects from inspector, including storage if storage is empty
  - creating a new iframe doesn't work, because it inherits variables from its parent
  - can create a window object "x = window.open()", but this creates a popup, and the window
    must remain open to access variables
  - is there a way to create a fresh window object, look at its properties, without popping open a window?
  - text was 'show common' checked by default

== bugs

- if form field is visible, and you click a property, it should revert the form field to plain text before processing
- on sites like last.fm, you get lots of blanks, plus reverse and forEach at the end of lists
- when width of columns is too wide, columns get bumped to line below
  - can set a width for the wrapper, except with Chrome (at least) width doesn't include the scrollbars

- background-color when viewing a long variable value scrolls
- what's rearwindow > columns > objects > dataset ?
- why is innerHTML always an empty string?
- window.organic_links on reddit is broken (when inspected through category items are blank)
