== need

== want

- hide button
- draggable
- when item is selected, and RW is focused, enable key navigation
- plugins for main JS libraries, to add their unique property types, and also event listeners (?)
- see events (per JS library)
- correct pluralisation
- backwards while loops are quicker than for loops
- autocomplete for choosing a variable

- option to remove all common objects from inspector, including storage if storage is empty
  - creating a new iframe doesn't work, because it inherits variables from its parent
  - can create a window object "x = window.open()", but this creates a popup, and the window
    must remain open to access variables
  - is there a way to create a fresh window object, look at its properties, without popping open a window?
  - text was 'show common' checked by default

== bugs

- when width of columns is too wide, columns get bumped to line below
  - can set a width for the wrapper, except with Chrome (at least)
  - width doesn't include the scrollbars 
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986937/javascript-get-the-browsers-scrollbar-sizes
- handle displaying "storage" (see window.menubar, window.sessionStorage in FF)
- background-color when viewing a long variable value scrolls
- what's rearwindow > columns > objects > dataset ?
- why is innerHTML always an empty string?
