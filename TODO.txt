== need

- close (/hide) button
- allow specifying what object to being inspecting

== want

- option to remove all common objects from inspector (probably by loading iframe and comparing list of variables), including storage if storage is empty
- draggable
- when item is selected, and RW is focused, enable key navigation
- plugins for main JS libraries, to add their unique property types, and also event listeners (?)
- see events (per JS library)

== bugs

- handle displaying "storage" (see window.menubar, window.sessionStorage in FF)
