== need

== want

- hide button
- option to remove all common objects from inspector (probably by loading iframe and comparing list of variables), including storage if storage is empty
- draggable
- when item is selected, and RW is focused, enable key navigation
- plugins for main JS libraries, to add their unique property types, and also event listeners (?)
- see events (per JS library)
- correct pluralisation

== bugs

- when width of columns is too wide, columns get bumped to line below
- handle displaying "storage" (see window.menubar, window.sessionStorage in FF)
- background-color when viewing a long variable value scrolls
- what's rearwindow > columns > objects > dataset ?
- why is innerHTML always an empty string?
